# 🧹 Web Scraping + Cleaning Huge Data (Simple English)

Web scraping helps us collect information automatically from websites.  
But raw scraped data is usually messy — it may have missing values, broken text, symbols, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.  

So I follow these simple steps:  

**✔ Step 1: Extract the Data**  
Use Python libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, or APIs to pull information such as titles, ratings, and descriptions.

**✔ Step 2: Clean the Data**  
- Remove duplicates  
- Fix missing values  
- Convert data types (dates, numbers)  
- Clean text  
- Standardize column names  

**✔ Step 3: Make It Ready for EDA**  
After cleaning, the dataset becomes neat and ready for:  
- Charts  
- Trend analysis  
- Insights  
- Machine learning  

This helps turn huge, unstructured data into something meaningful and easy to understand.
